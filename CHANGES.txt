Ongoing:
 - Volatility plugin
 - Volatility memorymap
 - merge in master

 - move interfaces into an interfaces module, maybe use abc.

Changes to architecture.txt:
 - IMemory: there is a memory dump concept. 
 - IMemoryLoader: a memory_loader helper reads the dump and creates a IMemory instance
    + sets the ITargetPlatform information (cpu, wordsize)
        + the ITargetPlatform wraps a CTypesProxy instance
    + sets the list of IMemoryMapping
 - the IMemory instance is the one way access to:
    + the list of IMemoryMapping
    + the CTypesProxy ctypes proxy object for this Memory host
    + the IHeapWalker helpers
 - the memory l


 - model should be an instance.
 - mapping should represent the memory dump entity
 - ctypes for internal haystack loading should be a Proxy ctypes, saved the mapping instance
