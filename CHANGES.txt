Ongoing:
 - Volatility plugin
 - Volatility memorymap
 - merge in master

 - move interfaces into an interfaces module, maybe use abc.

Changes to architecture.txt:
 - IMemoryHandler: there is a process memory concept (dump, live, vol, rekall) that need a handler.
 - IMemoryLoader: a memory loader is a helper class reads the dump and creates a IMemoryHandler instance
    + figures out the ITargetPlatform information (cpu, wordsize)
        + the ITargetPlatform wraps a CTypesProxy instance
    + figures out the list of IMemoryMapping
    + creates a IMemoryHandler with both previous element
 - the IMemoryHandler instance is the one way access to:
    + the list of IMemoryMapping
    + the CTypesProxy ctypes proxy object for this MemoryHandler host
    + the IHeapWalker helpers
 - the memory l


 - model should be an instance.
 - mapping should represent the memory dump entity
 - ctypes for internal haystack loading should be a Proxy ctypes, saved the mapping instance

 - Ran 212 tests in 58.233s
FAILED (failures=1, errors=106, skipped=6, expected failures=1)
 - move constraints to config flat file instead of python code
 - refactor to ctypes proxy class in instances instead of module.
 - design with abc ready interfaces
 - clean TU state, 0 errors
 - constraints config is case sensitive
 - fixed win7heapfinder and walker
 - adjusted basicmodel to use memeory_handler properly.
 - Ran 213 tests in 149.355s
FAILED (failures=2, errors=31, skipped=8, expected failures=2)
 - fixed the search API to a simple one
 - fixed the haystack search cli to the new API
 - Ran 213 tests in 169.886s
FAILED (errors=22, skipped=6, expected failures=2)
 - pretty much refactored haytack core and search in reverse.
 - Ran 229 tests in 347.116s
FAILED (errors=7, skipped=7, expected failures=3)
 - cleaned search API, with matching TU
 - the constraints model and listmodel are enforced by an MVC model

2015-06:
 - keep track of changes in this file
 - use travis-ci to compile
 - fix makefile in tests/ and sudo & virtualenv play together nicely
 - FIX OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long on ptrace file.seek - ignore vsyscall mmap that is in the higher mmap reagion
    + this is a temporary bugfix.
 - add memory dumps test case to a dropbox
 - fix the heap structures used by haystack for win7.
    + Constraints: Ignore HEAP_ENTRY SubSegmentCode pointer as it is encoded.
    + fix some ctypeslib bugs
 - fix the generation process for HEAP structures. ctypeslib and clang do not like circular dependencies.
 - fix the name generation in ctypeslib
 - autopep8 all
 - fix all TU to pass
 - fix installation requirements
 - fix test run
 - Script the generation of profiles
