Ongoing:
 - stabilisation of search
 - refactorisation of reverse

Changes to architecture.txt:
 - IMemoryHandler: there is a process memory concept (dump, live, vol, rekall) that need a handler.
 - IMemoryLoader: a memory loader is a helper class reads the dump and creates a IMemoryHandler instance
    + figures out the ITargetPlatform information (cpu, wordsize)
        + the ITargetPlatform wraps a CTypesProxy instance
    + figures out the list of IMemoryMapping
    + creates a IMemoryHandler with both previous element
 - the IMemoryHandler instance is the one way access to:
    + the list of IMemoryMapping
    + the CTypesProxy ctypes proxy object for this MemoryHandler host
    + the IHeapWalker helpers
 - the memory l

2015-06:
 - keep track of changes in this file
 - use travis-ci to compile
 - fix makefile in tests/ and sudo & virtualenv play together nicely
 - FIX OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long on ptrace file.seek - ignore vsyscall mmap that is in the higher mmap reagion
    + this is a temporary bugfix.
 - add memory dumps test case to a dropbox
 - fix the heap structures used by haystack for win7.
    + Constraints: Ignore HEAP_ENTRY SubSegmentCode pointer as it is encoded.
    + fix some ctypeslib bugs
 - fix the generation process for HEAP structures. ctypeslib and clang do not like circular dependencies.
 - fix the name generation in ctypeslib
 - autopep8 all
 - fix all TU to pass
 - fix installation requirements
 - fix test run
 - Script the generation of profiles
