scripts/haystack:
    Search for struct in memory. Memory can be a file dump or a live process.
    calls haystack.abouchet
    
haytack.abouchet:
    a) Wraps memory dump using Factory haystack.memory_mapper.MemoryMapper.
    MemoryMapper outputs haystack.memory_mapping.MemoryMappings, a wrapper
        around memory mappings.

    b) treatment of other cmd line args
    
    c) search for structure with haystack.abouchet.StructFinder


haystack.abouchet.StructFinder:
    a) iterate over mappings in filter
    b) try to load struct on each aligned offset 
        MemoryMapping.readStruct -> load x bytes
    c) validates constraints from structure declaration
        "struct instance".loadMembers
    d) iterate.
